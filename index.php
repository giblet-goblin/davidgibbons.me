                            <p>My primary and most important occupation is as a student. I am currently studying Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Technology at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College. I have enjoyed using electronics throughout my life, and fell in love with engineering over my time spent working as a camp counselor at Resica Falls Scout Reservation.</p>
                            <p>Why Technology? I prefer to see the implementation of technology and like to see projects through to their end as opposed to giving them up while they are still only in pen on paper. I do not stop until the requirements are met and satisfaction is achieved.</p>

My favorite jobs and projects have been one that have not only pushed the limits of my knowledge but have forced me to learn even more. These experiences range from opportunitiies to plan, organize, lead, design circuits, and program.</p>
